# 💼 Frontend Mentor – Profile Card Component

This is my solution to the [Profile Card Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) from Frontend Mentor.  
The goal was to recreate the given design as accurately as possible using only **HTML and CSS**.

---

## 🧩 Overview

A clean and minimal profile card built with semantic HTML and modern CSS.  
I focused on structure, layout, and small visual details to make the result match the original design.

### 🎯 Features

- Two background SVGs positioned with `background-position`
- Custom Google Font (**Kumbh Sans**)
- Centered flex layout
- Fully responsive and visually close to the design mockup

---

## 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Working with multiple background images
- Adjusting `margin`, `padding`, and `line-height` for pixel precision
- Using **Flexbox** for centering and alignment
- Importing and applying Google Fonts

---

## ⚙️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox & custom properties)
